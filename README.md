# OPS445 Lab 6 – File Input & Ouput and Exceptions'

Welcome to OPS445 Lab 6!

In this lab, you will strengthen your Python programming skills by working with file input/output (I/O) and exception handling. These skills are essential for building programs that interact with external data sources and can gracefully recover from runtime errors.

📚 Lab Objectives:
+ Learn how to open, read, and write files in Python
+ Practice using the with open(...) context manager for safer file handling
+ Explore different file modes (r, w, a) and their effects
+ Handle runtime errors with try/except/finally blocks
+ Combine file I/O and exception handling to build robust programs
+ Strengthen debugging skills by testing with valid and invalid inputs

📂 Lab Files:
You will create and work with the following files during this lab:
+ lab6a.py – Reading from files
+ lab6b.py – Writing to files
+ lab6c.py – Appending to files
+ lab6d.py – Exception handling with file operations
+ lab6e.py – Combining file I/O and exception handling

🧩 Tips & Tricks:
+ Always close files after use, or rely on the with open(...) context manager to do it automatically.
+ Test your programs with missing files or invalid data to ensure your exception handling works.
+ Use .read(), .readline(), and .readlines() to explore different ways of reading file content.
+ Keep your code modular—separate file-handling logic from data-processing logic for clarity.
+ Comment your code thoroughly to make debugging and grading easier.
